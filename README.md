# Project 3 of 5.

***

##I'm learning how to do small projects as part of the [Result school](https://result.school/) marathon.

Here i learned how to create a slider from pictures, in particular, i studied the transition property, with which you can animate this application.
After that, we looked at a more interesting way to spice up an application using Java Script.
